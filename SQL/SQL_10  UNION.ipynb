    "## SQL UNION\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is SQL UNION?\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, **UNION** is an operator used to combine the results of two or more `SELECT` queries into a single result set. It is used to merge the rows from multiple queries into one, creating a unified output. The **UNION** operator is particularly useful when you want to combine data from different tables or when you have similar queries with the same column structure and want to merge their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is SQL UNION used?\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL UNION is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set. It is particularly useful when you want to merge the data from different tables or when you have similar queries with the same column structure and want to stack their results on top of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how SQL UNION is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the SELECT Queries:** Determine the SELECT queries that you want to combine. The queries should have the same number of columns, and the columns' data types should be compatible. The order of columns in the SELECT queries must match.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use the UNION Operator:** In your SQL query, use the UNION keyword to combine the SELECT queries. Place the UNION operator between each SELECT query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ensure Data Compatibility:** Ensure that the columns in both SELECT queries are compatible, i.e., they have the same data types and are in the same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Eliminate Duplicate Rows (Optional):** By default, the UNION operator removes duplicate rows from the final result set. If you want to include duplicates, you can use the UNION ALL operator instead of UNION.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Retrieve Data:** Execute the SQL query, and the result will be a single result set containing the combined rows from all the SELECT queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two tables, \"employees\" and \"contractors,\" with similar structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Table: employees\n",
    "\n",
    "| emp_id | emp_name   | department |\n",
    "|--------|------------|------------|\n",
    "| 1      | John Doe   | HR         |\n",
    "| 2      | Jane Smith | Sales      |\n",
    "\n",
    "Table: contractors\n",
    "\n",
    "| cont_id | cont_name   | department |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|------------|\n",
    "| 101     | Mark Johnson| Finance    |\n",
    "| 102     | Sarah Brown | IT         |\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine the data from both tables into a single result set, you can use UNION:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT emp_id, emp_name, department FROM employees\n",
    "UNION\n",
    "SELECT cont_id, cont_name, department FROM contractors;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The result set will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "| emp_id | emp_name     | department |\n",
    "|--------|--------------|------------|\n",
    "| 1      | John Doe     | HR         |\n",
    "| 2      | Jane Smith   | Sales      |\n",
    "| 101    | Mark Johnson | Finance    |\n",
    "| 102    | Sarah Brown  | IT         |\n",
    "\n",
    "The UNION operator successfully combines the rows from the \"employees\" and \"contractors\" tables into a single result set, merging the data with similar structures. The result set contains distinct rows, removing any duplicates by default. If you want to include duplicates, you can use the UNION ALL operator instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does SQL UNION work?\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL UNION** works by combining the results of two or more `SELECT` queries into a single result set. It allows you to stack the rows from different queries on top of each other, creating a unified output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how **SQL UNION** works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two tables, `\"employees\"` and `\"contractors\"`, with similar structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Table: employees\n",
    "\n",
    "| emp_id | emp_name   | department |\n",
    "|--------|------------|------------|\n",
    "| 1      | John Doe   | HR         |\n",
    "| 2      | Jane Smith | Sales      |\n",
    "\n",
    "Table: contractors\n",
    "\n",
    "| cont_id | cont_name   | department |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|------------|\n",
    "| 101     | Mark Johnson| Finance    |\n",
    "| 102     | Sarah Brown | IT         |\n",
    "\n",
    "Example SQL query with **UNION**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT emp_id, emp_name, department FROM employees\n",
    "UNION\n",
    "SELECT cont_id, cont_name, department FROM contractors;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first `SELECT` query retrieves data from the `\"employees\"` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   emp_id | emp_name   | department\n",
    "   -------|------------|-----------\n",
    "   1      | John Doe   | HR\n",
    "   2      | Jane Smith | Sales\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second `SELECT` query retrieves data from the `\"contractors\"` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "   cont_id | cont_name    | department\n",
    "   --------|--------------|-----------\n",
    "   101     | Mark Johnson | Finance\n",
    "   102     | Sarah Brown  | IT\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The **UNION** operator combines the rows from both `SELECT` queries and removes duplicate rows (if any) to create a new result set:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   emp_id | emp_name     | department\n",
    "   -------|--------------|-----------\n",
    "   1      | John Doe     | HR\n",
    "   2      | Jane Smith   | Sales\n",
    "   101    | Mark Johnson | Finance\n",
    "   102    | Sarah Brown  | IT\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "The final result set contains all the rows from both tables, merged together as a single unified output. Any duplicate rows are removed, providing a unique set of rows in the result. This is how **SQL UNION** works, allowing you to combine data from multiple sources with similar structures into one consolidated result set."

    "### What is the difference between SQL JOIN and SQL UNION?\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL UNION and SQL JOIN are used for different purposes and have distinct functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SQL UNION:**\n",
    "   - **SQL UNION** is used to combine the results of two or more `SELECT` queries into a single result set.\n",
    "   - It requires that the number of columns and their data types in the `SELECT` queries be the same.\n",
    "   - It eliminates duplicate rows from the final result set by default, ensuring that each row is unique.\n",
    "   - It does not consider any relationship between tables; instead, it simply stacks the results vertically.\n",
    "   - The **UNION** operator is used for combining the results, and it does not require a common column or key between the tables.\n",
    "   - Example: \n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1\n",
    "     UNION\n",
    "     SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SQL JOIN:**\n",
    "   - **SQL JOIN** is used to combine rows from two or more related tables based on a common column or key.\n",
    "   - It is used to retrieve data from multiple tables simultaneously, merging information from different sources into a single result set.\n",
    "   - It requires a related column or key between the tables to establish a relationship for combining rows.\n",
    "   - The **JOIN** operation combines the rows based on matching values in the specified columns.\n",
    "   - There are different types of **JOINs**, such as **INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN**, each with specific behaviors.\n",
    "   - Example: \n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1\n",
    "     INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between **SQL UNION** and **SQL JOIN** is their purpose and behavior. **UNION** is used to combine the results of multiple queries with the same structure, while **JOIN** is used to retrieve data from related tables based on a common column or key. Each serves a unique role in SQL queries, allowing for powerful data manipulation and retrieval capabilities."
