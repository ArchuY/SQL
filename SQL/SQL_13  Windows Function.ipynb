    "## WINDOW FUNCTIONS in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are WINDOW FUCTIONS in SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Window functions**, also known as **analytical functions or windowing functions**, are a powerful feature in SQL that allows data analysts to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row within a specified window or frame. Unlike regular aggregate functions, window functions do not group rows into a single result but provide results for each row individually, considering the context of neighboring rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points about Window Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Partitioning**: Window functions are typically used in conjunction with the OVER clause to define a partition of the data. The partition divides the result set into groups based on one or more columns, and the window function operates on each partition independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ordering**: To establish the order of rows within each partition, an ORDER BY clause is often used. The window function considers the order to define the window frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Window Frame**: The window frame defines the range of rows that the window function considers for each row. It can be a specific number of rows before and after the current row (ROWS frame), or it can be defined by a range of values (RANGE frame) depending on the ordering of the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Window Functions vs. Aggregate Functions**: While aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT) collapse multiple rows into a single result, window functions operate on individual rows and maintain the same number of rows as the original query.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Common Window Functions**: Some common window functions include `ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, NTILE, LAG, LEAD, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, and more`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Window Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a sample table `\"sales\"` with columns `\"product_id,\" \"sale_date,\" and \"revenue\"`. We want to calculate the total revenue for each product and the cumulative revenue for each sale date within each product.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  product_id,\n",
    "  sale_date,\n",
    "  revenue,\n",
    "  SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY sale_date) AS cumulative_revenue\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "  sales;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `SUM window function` with the `OVER clause` is used to calculate the cumulative revenue for each product. The `PARTITION BY clause` divides the data into partitions based on `\"product_id,\"` and the `ORDER BY clause` orders the rows within each partition by `\"sale_date.\"` The window frame implicitly considers all rows from the beginning of the partition up to the current row for the `SUM` calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Window Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplified Queries**: Window functions help avoid complex self-joins or subqueries that would be required to achieve similar results without window functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enhanced Data Analysis**: Window functions enable deeper data analysis by providing insights into the distribution and trends within data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ranking and Percentiles**: Window functions allow the calculation of ranks, percentiles, and other metrics relative to other rows in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Time Series Analysis**: Window functions are valuable in time series analysis, where calculations need to consider trends over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use SQL WINDOW FUNCTIONS?\n",
    "\n",
    "To use **window functions in SQL**, you need to understand the syntax and how to combine window functions with the `OVER clause` to define the window frame for calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use window functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Syntax**:\n",
    "The basic syntax of a **window function** is as follows:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "\n",
    "<window_function> OVER (PARTITION BY <partition_column(s)> ORDER BY <order_column(s)> <window_frame>)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explaination:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `<window_function>`: The window function to be used, such as ROW_NUMBER, RANK, SUM, AVG, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `PARTITION BY`: (Optional) Divides the result set into partitions based on one or more columns. The window function is applied independently to each partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ORDER BY`: (Optional) Defines the order of rows within each partition. It is used to determine the rows considered in the window frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `<window_frame>`: (Optional) Specifies the range of rows that the window function considers. It can be a specific number of rows before and after the current row (ROWS frame), or it can be defined by a range of values (RANGE frame) depending on the ordering of the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using Window Functions with PARTITION BY**:\n",
    "Window functions are often used in combination with the PARTITION BY clause to calculate results within distinct partitions of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  department,\n",
    "  employee_name,\n",
    "  salary,\n",
    "  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS ranking\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "  employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the ROW_NUMBER window function assigns a rank to employees within each department based on their salary in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using Window Functions with ORDER BY**:\n",
    "The ORDER BY clause in the OVER clause specifies the order of rows within each partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  department,\n",
    "  employee_name,\n",
    "  salary,\n",
    "  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS overall_ranking\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "  employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the RANK window function calculates the overall ranking of employees based on their salary across all departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using Window Functions with WINDOW FRAME**:\n",
    "The WINDOW FRAME clause specifies the range of rows that the window function considers for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with ROWS frame:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  department,\n",
    "  employee_name,\n",
    "  salary,\n",
    "  SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING) AS salary_sum\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "  employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the SUM window function calculates the sum of salaries for each employee and the two employees before and after them within the same department.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do SQL WINDOW FUNCTIONS work?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Window functions in SQL** operate on a set of rows related to the current row within a specified window or frame. They are distinct from regular aggregate functions because they provide results for each row individually, considering the context of neighboring rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how window functions work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Partitioning**:\n",
    "The PARTITION BY clause in SQL is a component of window functions. It divides the result set into partitions to which the window function is applied. Essentially, it allows you to perform a calculation across a set of rows that are somehow related to the current row, similar to how GROUP BY aggregates rows, but without collapsing them into a single output row per group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an employees table with columns for department_id and salary. If you want to calculate the average salary in each department, while still displaying every employee's salary, you could write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    department_id, \n",
    "    name, \n",
    "    salary, \n",
    "    AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) AS avg_department_salary\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This SQL query does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Partitioning: Divides the employees into partitions based on their department_id.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculating Average: For each partition (department), it calculates the average salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Displaying Results: The result set will include every row from the original employees table, but with an additional column avg_department_salary showing the average salary for the department of each employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ordering**:\n",
    "To establish the order of rows within each partition, you can use the ORDER BY clause. The window function considers the ordering of rows to define the window frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Window Frame**:\n",
    "The window frame determines the range of rows that the window function considers for each row. It can be specified using the ROWS or RANGE keyword in the OVER clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "   a. **ROWS Frame**:\n",
    "      The ROWS frame defines a specific number of rows before and after the current row. For example, `ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING` considers the current row and the rows immediately before and after it.\n",
    "      \n",
    "Example with Row frame:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  id,\n",
    "  date,\n",
    "  amount,\n",
    "  SUM(amount) OVER (\n",
    "    ORDER BY date\n",
    "    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW\n",
    "  ) as running_total\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "  sales;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this query:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SUM(amount) OVER (...) is a window function that calculates the sum of amount.\n",
    "- ORDER BY date orders the rows within each window by the date of sale.\n",
    "- ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW specifies the row frame. It means that for each row, the sum will be calculated over all rows from the start of the dataset (UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) up to the current row (CURRENT ROW).\n",
    "- This query will return a result set where each row contains the original data (id, date, amount) along with the running total up to that row.\n",
    "\n",
    "   b. **RANGE Frame**:\n",
    "      The RANGE frame defines a range of values based on the ordering of rows. It includes rows whose values fall within the specified range. For example, `RANGE BETWEEN 10 PRECEDING AND 10 FOLLOWING` considers rows with values within 10 units of the current row's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with RANGE frame:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  sale_date,\n",
    "  revenue,\n",
    "  AVG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL 7 DAYS PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_average\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "  sales;\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the AVG window function calculates the moving average revenue for each sale date within a range of 7 days before the current row.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Window Function Execution**:\n",
    "The window function is executed for each row in the result set. For each row, the window frame determines which rows are included in the window function's calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Result Calculation**:\n",
    "For each row, the window function performs the specified calculation using the rows within the window frame. The result is then included as a separate column in the output for that row.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **No Row Reduction**:\n",
    "Unlike regular aggregate functions like SUM or AVG, window functions do not reduce the number of rows in the result set. Each row in the result set retains its original values, and the window function's result is appended as an additional column.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Window Functions:\n",
    "There are various window functions available in SQL, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ROW_NUMBER**: Assigns a unique number to each row based on the specified ordering within the partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, salary, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as row_num\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RANK and DENSE_RANK**: Assign ranks to rows based on specified criteria, with DENSE_RANK handling ties differently than RANK.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: **RANK()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The RANK() function assigns a unique rank to each row within a partition of a result set, with gaps in rank values when there are ties. When multiple rows share the same value (and hence the same rank), the next rank is not consecutive but is increased by the number of tied rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset of scores: 90, 80, 80, 70. The RANK() function would assign ranks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first row (score 90) gets rank 1.\n",
    "The next two rows (both score 80) get rank 2.\n",
    "The fourth row (score 70) gets rank 4 (not 3, because two rows are tied for rank 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT score, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) as rank\n",
    "FROM scores;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:**DENSE_RANK()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The DENSE_RANK() function also assigns a unique rank to each row within a partition, but unlike RANK(), it does not create gaps in rank values when there are ties. This means that the next rank after a tie is always one more than the current rank, regardless of the number of tied rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Using the same dataset of scores: 90, 80, 80, 70. The DENSE_RANK() function would assign ranks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first row (score 90) gets rank 1.\n",
    "The next two rows (both score 80) get rank 2.\n",
    "The fourth row (score 70) gets rank 3 (it directly follows rank 2, with no gap).\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT score, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) as dense_rank\n",
    "FROM scores;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX**: Calculate aggregate values for the rows within the window frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PERCENT_RANK()**: PERCENT_RANK() is an SQL window function that calculates the relative rank of a row within a partition of a result set. It essentially expresses the rank of a row as a percentage between 0 and 1, relative to the other rows in the partition. This function is particularly useful when you want to understand the position of a value within a distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The lowest rank (the first row in the ordered set) always has a PERCENT_RANK of 0.\n",
    "- The highest rank (the last row in the ordered set) always has a PERCENT_RANK of 1.\n",
    "- For partitions with only one row, the PERCENT_RANK of that row is 0 (since the denominator in the formula becomes 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a table employees with salaries. To calculate the PERCENT_RANK of each employee's salary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, salary, PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS percent_rank\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "If there are 5 employees with salaries of 30k, 40k, 50k, 60k, and 70k, the PERCENT_RANK for each salary would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "30k: (1 - 1) / (5 - 1) = 0 (0%)\n",
    "\n",
    "40k: (2 - 1) / (5 - 1) = 0.25 (25%)\n",
    "\n",
    "50k: (3 - 1) / (5 - 1) = 0.5 (50%)\n",
    "\n",
    "60k: (4 - 1) / (5 - 1) = 0.75 (75%)\n",
    "\n",
    "70k: (5 - 1) / (5 - 1) = 1 (100%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, PERCENT_RANK provides a way to assess each salary's position relative to the others. For example, a salary at the 75th percentile means that 75% of the salaries are the same or less than that salary. This function is especially useful in statistical analyses where percentile rankings are important, such as determining quartiles or understanding the distribution of data within a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CUME_DIST():** CUME_DIST() is an SQL window function that calculates the cumulative distribution of a value within a set of values. It essentially shows the relative position of a value within a partition or result set. The function calculates the proportion of rows that have a value less than or equal to the value in the current row, including the current row itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, salary, CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as cume_dist\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LEAD and LAG**: Access data from subsequent or previous rows relative to the current row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: **LEAD**\n",
    "\n",
    "Provides access to a row at a given physical offset that follows the current row.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, salary, LEAD(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) as next_salary\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: **LAG**\n",
    "\n",
    "Accesses data from a previous row in the table without the need for a self-join.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, salary, LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) as prev_salary\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NTILE**: Divides the rows within each partition into specified numbers of roughly equal groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, salary, NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as quartile\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Example:\n",
    "Let's consider a sample table \"sales\" with columns \"product_id,\" \"sale_date,\" and \"revenue.\" We want to calculate the total revenue for each product and the cumulative revenue for each sale date within each product.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "  product_id,\n",
    "  sale_date,\n",
    "  revenue,\n",
    "  SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY sale_date) AS cumulative_revenue\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "  sales;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the **SUM window function** with the `OVER clause` calculates the cumulative revenue for each product. The `PARTITION BY clause` divides the data into partitions based on `\"product_id,\"` and the `ORDER BY clause` orders the rows within each partition by `\"sale_date.\"` The window frame implicitly considers all rows from the beginning of the partition up to the current row for the SUM calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Window functions in SQL add significant analytical capabilities by allowing calculations to be performed across rows in a partitioned and ordered result set. They provide a powerful toolset for data analysts to gain deeper insights into data patterns, perform ranking and percentile analysis, and enable sophisticated time series calculations. By leveraging window functions effectively, data analysts can elevate their data analysis and gain valuable insights from complex datasets."
